# Description
This is my first portfolio, build after finalizing the first 10 weeks of learning MERN FullStack development course | MIT xPro Coding for Women Course.
HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap have been used to build the portfolio.
All the code has been written. No template is used for the portfolio.

# Installation
How to view and/or use this project

# Download files
Download and keep all files in their respective folders as they are shown in the repository. Open the index.html file in your browser to access the project.
There will be noted a diffference when opening and accessing the portfolio locally in your PC. It will look better with all the bootstrap styles applied. Meanwhile, when accessing it directly in the web, because of the -webkit-apperance usage, main manu and the buttons will not get the right styles applied. 
While exploring my portfolio, in the Home Page you can access:
- My profile photo
- My Resume (downloadable)
- A video presenation linked to my Youtube Channel
- My expertise and the formats for contacting me by call, LinkedIn, GitHub.

If you click on Project / Portfolio menus ju jump into a second page, from where you can access my 3 main projects:
- Pacmen Factory
- Eyes Movement
- Bus Tracker

You can go back to the main page of my portfolio again.
